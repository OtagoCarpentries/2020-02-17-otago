<h3 id="spreadsheet-program">Spreadsheet program</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>To interact with spreadsheets, we can use LibreOffice, Microsoft Excel, Gnumeric, OpenOffice.org, or other programs. 
Commands may differ a bit between programs, but the general ideas for thinking about spreadsheets are the same. For this workshop, 
we recommend using either Microsoft Excel (paid software) or LibreOffice (free and open source). Other spreadsheet programs may
not have all of the features we will be exploring in this workshop.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To install LibreOffice, go to their <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/">download page</a>. The website should
automatically select the correct option for your operating system. Click the “Download” button. You will go to a page that asks about a
donation, but you don’t need to make one. Your download should begin automatically. Once the installer is downloaded, double click on it (you may need to open your Downloads folder) and LibreOffice should install.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="r-and-rstudio">R and RStudio</h3>

<ul>
  <li>R and RStudio are separate downloads and installations. R is the
underlying statistical computing environment, but using R alone is no
fun. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes
using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install R before you
install RStudio. After installing both programs, you will need to install 
some specific R packages within RStudio. Follow the instructions below for
your operating system, and then follow the instructions to install
<strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tidyverse</code></strong> and <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RSQLite</code></strong>.</li>
</ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Open RStudio, and click on “Help” &gt; “Check for updates”. If a new version is
available, quit RStudio, and download the latest version for RStudio.</li>
    <li>To check which version of R you are using, start RStudio and the first thing
 that appears in the console indicates the version of R you are
 running. Alternatively, you can type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sessionInfo()</code>, which will also display
 which version of R you are running. Go on
 the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/">CRAN website</a> and check
whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install
it. You can <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#How-do-I-UNinstall-R_003f">check here</a> for
more information on how to remove old versions from your system if you wish to do so.</li>

<h4 id="linux">Linux</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Follow the instructions for your distribution
 from <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux">CRAN</a>, they provide information
 to get the most recent version of R for common distributions. For most
 distributions, you could use your package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu run
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo apt-get install r-base</code>, and for Fedora <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo yum install R</code>), but we
 don’t recommend this approach as the versions provided by this are
 usually out of date. In any case, make sure you have at least R 3.5.1.</li>
  <li>Go to the <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">RStudio download
page</a></li>
  <li>Under <em>Installers</em> select the version that matches your distribution, and
 install it with your preferred method (e.g., with Debian/Ubuntu <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo dpkg -i
 rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb</code> at the terminal).</li>
  <li>
    <p>Once it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any
 error messages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>After installing R and RStudio, you need to install the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tidyverse</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RSQLite</code> packages. Start RStudio by double-clicking the icon and then type:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">install.packages(c("tidyverse", "RSQLite"))</code>. You can also do this by going to Tools -&gt; Install Packages and 
typing the names of the packages you want to install, separated by a comma.</li>

          The default shell in some versions of macOS is Bash, and
	  Bash is available in all versions, so no need to install anything.
	  You access Bash from the Terminal (found in

          See the Git installation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LQhwETCdwY ">video tutorial</a>
